\frametitle{First Test}


OK, let's get started with just some text:


<<echo=FALSE,results='hide'>>=
# some setup
options(width=60)  # make the printing fit on the page
set.seed(1121)   # make the results repeatable
@

<<>>=
# create some random numbers
(x=rnorm(20))
mean(x);var(x)
@


BTW, the first element of \texttt{x} is \Sexpr{x[1]}. (Did you notice
the use of\texttt{ \textbackslash{}Sexpr\{\}}?)
